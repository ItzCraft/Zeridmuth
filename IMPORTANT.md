so, this mod, Zeridmuth
If you see this you might have either tried to do either of this things: Take some .hjson files for refrence of your own projects/mod, or take some sprites.
please read some of these allowance and prohibition to prevent any future issues.

you are allowed to take code, but in return you must credit.

you are not allowed to take any sprites or media (images, sounds) from this mod for it to be released alongside with your own projects. only use them for private uses and not commercial or for personal profit.

you are only allowed to take a few sprites with a strict license from me. for more information contact straight into my discord server or account which is avialable below this page.

notable exceptions that is allowed to take code is the Planets. You are not allowed to copy the planet as a whole, you either need it to make it a different color, size, or different seed and meshes. this also requires credit of the original author, me.
